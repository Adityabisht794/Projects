11/13/24, 6:27 PM - Akshay Sir: These are some of the Mini Projects which you can build inorder to learn Nodejs.
Those who already know NodeJS can proceed with more complex Projects.


URL Shortener:
Create a URL shortening service that takes a long URL as input and generates a shortened version.

When a user visits the shortened URL, they should be redirected to the original long URL.

You can use Express and a database like MongoDB to store the mappings between the short and long URLs.

Expense Tracker: Develop an expense tracking application where users can input their expenses, categorize them, and generate reports or visualizations of their spending habits.

You can use packages like Chart.js or Plotly.js to create charts and graphs.

File Uploader:
Create a file uploader using Node.js and a package like multer.

Users should be able to select and upload files, which should be stored on the server.

You can add features like file validation, resizing, and handling different file types.

Currency Converter:
Create a currency converter application that fetches real-time exchange rates from an API and allows users to convert between different currencies.

You can use packages like axios to make API requests and display the converted results.

To do App:
Build a command-line to-do list application using Node.js.

Users should be able to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

You can use libraries like readline or inquirer to interact with the user through the command line.

Web Scraper:
Create a web scraping tool that extracts specific information from web pages.

Users should be able to provide a URL and specify the elements or data they want to scrape.

You can use packages like Cheerio or Puppeteer for web scraping.

Authentication System:
Implement user authentication and registration using Node.js and a package like Passport.js.

Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out.

You can use a database like MongoDB to store user information securely.


Chat Application:
Build a real-time chat application using Node.js and Socket.IO.

Users should be able to join chat rooms, send messages, and receive messages in real-time.

Socket.IO makes it easy to implement real-time communication between the server and clients.

Additionally, the knowledge gained will be invaluable for excelling in other competitive exams such as CAT, Bank PO, SSC CGL, RBI Grade B, UPSC, and various state-level public service commission exams. The strong analytical, logical reasoning, and problem-solving skills developed through these subjects will also give you an edge in assessments for roles in government organizations like DRDO, ISRO, BARC, and Indian Railways.

Gentle reminder! 
Kindly fill the registration form for GATE CSE Classes by 21, January, 2025.
Registration Link: https://forms.gle/dMyYnsyNEcAzAU846.


Also, in this Class for GATE CSE, due to a significant overlap with the GATE Data Analytics (DA) syllabus which is around 70-80% of the DA syllabus being covered within the CSE syllabus. A substantial portion of the content is similar, particularly in areas like data structures, algorithms, statistics, database mgmt, and mathematics. Hence, these classes will be helpful for those who opt for GATE DA paper also.

2/15/25, 9:37 PM - Anubhav Sir: I have given two options for selecting mentor, in the Software Engineering (S.E.) related form:
1) At Q. No.:08 -> You can write the name of the mentor, you wish.
2) At Q. No: 09 -> You must select many other names, other than you mentioned in Q. No. 08, so that if you do not get the mentor you mentioned in Q. No. 08 then we'll provide another mentor of your choice.

Many of you are selecting the same name as written by you in Q. No. 08...that's of no use, you are simply missing a choice.
*In case of queries, please contact me via personal WhatsApp msg.*

2/17/25, 3:08 PM - Anubhav Sir: *Clarification regarding Group formation for Software Engineering based projects:*
As per the instructions received in this context, please read and understand point no. 2, i.e., a team can have max 02 students from the same section. The rest 02 members have to be from two different sections, they cannot be from the same section. In this way, every team will have students from atleast three different sections. You cannot make a team with 2 pairs of students; one pair taken from a section and the other pair taken from some other section. This is wrong.
Please do not misinterpret this clause.

This not only reflects a lack of seriousness but also deprives other interested students of valuable opportunities. Such behavior is unacceptable and will invite disciplinary action.

All enrolled students are strictly required to complete the assigned modules within the given deadlines.
Failure will result in:

*60% deduction in GP marks.*

Students are strongly advised to adhere to the above-mentioned guidelines to avoid any strict disciplinary action against them.

Sahil was not only an outstanding student but also a gentle and humble individual whose passion, kindness, and determination left a lasting impact on everyone who knew him. His presence enriched our campus, and his absence will be deeply felt.
Our heartfelt condolences go out to his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time. May his soul rest in eternal peace, and may his life continue to inspire us all.

About the Program:
This program offers a unique learning opportunity for youth to enhance their employability and leadership skills and provides students from across India an opportunity to demonstrate their ability and skills at the annual HSBC-University of Hong Kong (HKU) Asia-Pacific Business Case program.
 
About India Business Case program:
The India Business Case program is supported by HSBC India and is implemented by United Way of Mumbai and Sattva Consulting. The program features hybrid training workshops, interactions with industry professionals and masterclasses, providing participants with practical insights and real-world business perspectives.

The top two teams stand a chance to represent India at the HSBC-University of Hong Kong (HKU) Asia-Pacific Business Case program – a premier program that brings together teams of undergraduate students from countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

The 2021 Asia-Pacific round was even won by an Indian team, which was selected through the India Business Case program.

In 2024-25, the program received nearly ~8,000 student registrations from 158 colleges across the country. Students in the national round also got the opportunity to engage with top business leaders.
This year, we are delighted to invite students from your esteemed institution to register for the program. We believe this is an incredible opportunity for your students to apply their theoretical learnings in a practical context.

The India Business Case program aims to offer exposure through:
In-person regional workshops, focused on building knowledge and skills useful in solving business case studies, which are often part of campus-hiring processes of companies as well as consulting firms
Video pitch rounds for the students to assess their problem solving and presentation skills
Opportunity for national round finalists to interact with industry professionals and gain valuable insights on leadership. 
 
Students can register online by filling this registration form. Kindly circulate the same to ensure maximum participation in the program. For more details regarding the program, please refer to the FAQ sheet attached to this email and the recap video from last year here.

7/6/25, 3:33 PM - Devesh Sir: NOTICE - HackWithInfy

It has been observed that a number of students did not attend the mock test that was scheduled on the previous dates. This act is highly disappointing and reflects poorly on our campus and our department.

The department believes that either such students are not interested in placement activities or they do not value the placement events organized by the University. Therefore, the department will identify these students and strict action will be taken against them. Such students may be debarred from all future placement activities.

Additionally, Director Sir and HoD Sir will hold discussions with these students regarding their lack of participation.

All students are advised to take placement activities seriously and ensure active participation in future events.

Kindly communicate these points clearly with the students to help minimize challenges and avoid recurring issues.

Students are required to attend the sessions using their registered email IDs. However, if student joined the sessions with different email IDs. Please note that attendance is strictly mapped using the registered email ID and phone number. Any mismatch will result in the student being marked as absent. Kindly ensure this instruction is clearly communicated to all colleges.

To clarify for all students:
             In order to gain access to the labs, students must create their Google Cloud Skills Boost account using the same email ID they used to register for the internship program. That same email ID should be submitted in the form.

             If a student uses a different email ID to create the Skills Boost account and submit the form, we can still provide lab access, but we won’t be able to verify if the student belongs to the NASSCOM Virtual Internship Program, which may impact tracking and reporting.

  Students who have filled out the required form but haven’t received lab credits must raise a support request by emailing: akshata@thesmartbridge.com (Please ask them to mention their full name, email ID used for registration and describe the issue.)
        3. Missing Emails:
Students who haven't received internship-related emails are requested to check their inbox (and spam/junk folder) for messages from the following email IDs: skillwallet@thesmartbridge.com / akshata@thesmartbridge.com
4. Session Timing
The session timing for Cohort 3 will be from 06:00 AM to 08:00 PM.

8/7/25, 1:30 PM - Ankur Sir: Internship Opportunity at a Deep Tech Startup (AI + Web3)

Location: Remote
Type: Paid Internship | Flexible Duration | PPO Opportunity

About Us

We are an AI + Web3 startup on a mission to automate complex Web3 workflows using cutting-edge Multi-Agent Systems. From on-chain analysis to decentralized governance automation, we’re building the next-gen infrastructure where intelligent agents power every step of the blockchain ecosystem.

If you’re excited by the intersection of AI, crypto, and systems design — you’ll love what we’re working on.

Opportunity

As an intern, you’ll work directly with our Co-founder (VP of Engineering) on building both AI agents and our Layer-1 blockchain infrastructure — gaining hands-on experience in two of the most cutting-edge domains of tech today.

This is a paid internship with no fixed end date. If you perform well, we’d love for you to continue with us through your final year, with a pre-placement offer (PPO) on the table before you graduate.

You’ll operate with high ownership, learn from senior leaders, and build real systems that will shape the future of AI and Web3.

Skills & Requirements

We’re looking for passionate builders who thrive in fast-moving environments and love solving hard problems with code.

You must have:

Strong programming foundation — you genuinely love writing code.
A problem-solving mindset with the courage to learn through experimentation.
Vibe coding energy — you code for fun, not just for deadlines.
Solid command over Python with willingness to learn new languages like Solidity, Rust, TypeScript etc.
A high sense of ownership, curiosity, and responsibility.
The Team

Our founding team consists of serial entrepreneurs and alumni of Oxford University (also a JIITian), Georgia Tech, and an investment banker at Deutsche Bank. Together, we bring a deep blend of technical depth and strategic insight across AI, crypto, and financial systems.
